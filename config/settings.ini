; LOCKOUTDURATION is the number of HOURS that bad IPs are banned. After this interval passes, bad IPs are unbanned.
; FAILEDLOGINTHRESHOLD is the number of failed logins that must occur within LOGCHECKINTERVAL for an IP to be banned.
; LOGLOOKBACKINTERVAL is how many MINUTES back the logs should be checked for failed logins. Adjust this based on the time between failures.
LOCKOUTDURATION=12
FAILEDLOGINTHRESHOLD=5
LOGLOOKBACKINTERVAL=15
